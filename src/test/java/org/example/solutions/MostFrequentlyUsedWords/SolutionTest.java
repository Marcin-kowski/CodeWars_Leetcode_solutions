                             mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
                             in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
                             coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
                             nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
                             on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income."""
